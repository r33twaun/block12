                <p>This is a website I have been working on for a long time now. Ever since the very first week of my school
                    I have set the website aside and slowly built on to it over the months. I consider it my own little facebook.

            <section class="about-text2">
                <p>This is my first group project. I remember when the teach said we were going to start doing group projects
                    and it made me so excited. I love working with other developers to learn in and outs bits and pieces
                    to further my knowledge to make me more resilient. In turn everyone wins because we all learn and stay
                    up-to-date.
