                <p>I am human and I make mistakes like everyone else but I also aspire to gain experience
                    as a Software Developer to minimize those mistakes. This in turn raises 
                    production and reduces cost. Don't forget we want work to be enjoyable
                    for all races and cultures and I strive to make that happen to the best
                    of my ability!
